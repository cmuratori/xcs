Exquisite Cream Sauce (Sauce à la Crème Exquise)

This is a complete hack piece of garbage. It is designed to take an executable that runs something very small (like an ASM kernel) and run it through perf with every possible perf counter on Skylake, so you can see what they all are.

If you don't know what any of that means, definitely don't use this program.  That's literally all it does.  It's a glorified batch file I wrote in like ten minutes.
